[Unsolved] - The form in sign_in.html.erb somehow is not applied with the validators in User Model -> can still send out empty entry
[Unsolved] - QRcode will over-write each other. ".each" didn't act as expected. 

[ToDo] - Should probably change route of User Page to show.html.erb (instead of using index.html.erb)
[ToDo] - Moving the css style into Webpacker -> rails server is damn slow.
[ToDo] - Apply "devise" gem and "paranoia" gem
