[Unsolved] - The form in sign_in.html.erb somehow doesn't be applied with the validators in User Model -> can still send out empty entry
[Unsolved] - Sign-in page (sign_in.html.erb) flash message doesn't show up at all ???
[ToThinkAbout] - Should probably change route of User Page to show.html.erb (instead of using index.html.erb)
